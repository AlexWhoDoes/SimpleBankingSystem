# SimpleBankingSystem
That is a pet project of a simple banking system. It kind of how the banking system works but in a very simplified way.
I implemented the Luhn algorithm that protects from mistakes when entering the card number. 
Also, it is my first attempt to use SQL, in that case, it is SQLite.
